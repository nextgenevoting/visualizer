\section{Week 1}
\subsection{Reflexion}

During our kickoff meeting we discussed the several possibilities of our
bachelor thesis based on the spadework of the previous "project 2" module and
broke them down into two options: A realistic prototype of the whole chVote
system that includes everything a real implementation would need, like
signatures, channel security, distributed election authorities with docker
etc., or an interative prototype ("demonstrator") that allows to demonstrate
the functionality of the chVote protocol in a more visual manner.

\section{Week 2}
\subsection{Reflexion}

The following week we have made the decision to build the demonstrator mainly
because the final product would potentially be more attractive visually than a
prototype where the main work is hidden behind the scences. We have also
started thinking about what technologies and frameworks to use and to build a
few sketches and mockups to have some basis for discussion for our next
meeting. At this stage we have yet been very unsure about how the application
should look like, what audience we should have as our main target and what
functionality the application should offer.

During our second meeting we ellaborated the goals and some more technical details.
\begin{itemize}
\item In essence, the application should allow to demonstrate a chVote election from the view of every party participating in the election process.
\item The system should manage multiple elections
\item The application should be a realtime webapp that updates the views automatically as soon as something changes and without having to reload the page
\end{itemize}

\section{Week 4}
\subsection{Reflexion}

In the third week we finished describing the goals and further worked on the
system architecture. We also made some first experiences with the envisaged
frameworks and technologies (VueJS, socket.io, Flask, MongoDB).

\begin{itemize}
\item working with socket.io and VueJS has been very intuitive and looked very promising and suitable for our project
\item We were not yet sure whether or not mongoDB is the right technology for our needs.
\end{itemize}
